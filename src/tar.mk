# Before we surrender to -DMSDOS=1, here is the remaining unresolved symbols list:
# - fork, waitpid and (though not technically symbols) wait status testing macros.
#
#   Equivalent Windows code exists; however, I would be reluctant to use it in tar
#   because of the GPL lock-in, and I would be reluctant to release it as a shared
#   library until it is sufficiently mature. The fork-pipe-wait "*nix way" demands
#   much more than a few system calls mapped to each other because they are "kinda
#   equivalent". Current patches, for example, remove all SIGPIPE dependent code.
#
# Until these issues are ironed out, the current build does not support compressed
# or remote archives. Fortunately, however menial its use cases become, they will,
# at least, stay forward-compatible once a functional shell is ported and *nix way
# process composition is finally available. Patches are broken down into long-term
# "fixes" and short-term "hacks".
#
# Better (both license-wise and portability-wise) TAR implementations *DO* exist -
# if we are ready for fine tuning of their command line switches.
#
# KNOWN: libtar builds statically as libtar.a (not a big loss due to GPL, though).
